// --- 1. Global Middleware (App-level settings) ---

// Enable CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
// This allows your Flutter app (from a different 'origin') to make requests
// to this API (localhost:3000). Required for development.
app.use(cors());

// Enable the express.json() middleware (you already had this)
// This parses incoming JSON requests (like from Flutter) 
// and puts the data in req.body. CRITICAL for POST requests.

// --- 2. Mount Routes ---

// Tell Express to use the 'authRoutes' for any URL starting with '/api/auth'
// This keeps your server.js clean and organized.
// e.g., a request to '/api/auth/register' will be handled by authRoutes.

    // This will create the 'users' table if it doesn't exist.
    // { force: false } (default) won't drop tables if they exist (safe).
    // { force: true } WILL drop and recreate tables (WARNING: data loss!)
    await sequelize.sync({ force: false }); 
    console.log("✅ Database models synchronized.");

    // Start the Express server only *after* the database is ready
    app.listen(PORT, () => {

    // If database connection fails, stop the server from starting
    console.error("❌ Unable to start server:", error);
